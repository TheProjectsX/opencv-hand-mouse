# Hand Controlled Cursor

Control cursor without Mouse

### Technologies Used:

- OpenCV
- Mediapipe

### Packages Used:

- opencv-python
- mediapipe
- cvzone
- pyautogui (For Cursor control and Screenshots)

```shell script
pip install opencv-python mediapipe cvzone pyautogui
```

### Methods:

##### [1] Index finger control:

We use pyautogui's Screenshot method to make the screen live in the video feed. In the feed, by watching, we can move our Index Finger accordingly to move the Cursor on the Screen

This version contains Bugs even I don't have count of

##### [2] Invisible Touch Pad:

In this version, we use Air as a Touch Pad! We basically move our index finger as if we are using a touch pad.

This one is more reliable than the other one. I actually wanted to write this program in the beginning. But wrote the Above one instead!

Turns out my Gut was right for this one!

### Button Clicks:

- **Single Click** can be performed by standing Index and Pinky fingers Up (For both methods)
- **Double Click** Can be performed by standing only Pinky finger Up (For second method only)
